        <h1>HTML5 FOR WEB DESIGNERS</h1>
        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5 is the cirrent version of the web mark-up language. It has is origins from <em>HTML 2.0</em></li>
                <li>XHTML 1 introduced a stricter markup from XML</li>
                <li>XHTML 2 advanced from XHTML 1.0 and sought to replace HTML 4.01 which was a complete failure</li>
                <li>WHATWG a rebellion that broke off from W3C whose main goal is to extend HTML to allow the creation of web applications.</li>
                <li>Currently two groups work on HTML5.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>HTML5 design principles are:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supporting the existing content</li>
                        <li>Don't reinvent the wheel</li>
                        <li>Pave the cowpaths</li>
                        <li>Priority of constituencies</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>HTML5 has specifications for what needs to be done in the event well formatted markup is parsed and likewise when badly formatted markup is parsed</li>
                <li>To echo the point above HTML5 is written for both authors and <em>implementers</em></li>
                <li>One key change is how the doctype is defined in HTML5 <strong>***</strong>. It is so because it HTML5 has to be backward compatible and therefore it makes no sense stating the version number </li>
                <li>Browsers support features not doctype</li>
                <li>You can omit the <em>type</em> attribute from <em>script and link</em> tags for javascript and stylesheets since they are the standard</li>
                <li>Obsolete elements such as <em>frame, frameset, noframes, acronym, font, big, center, strike, bgcolor, cellspacing, cellpadding and valign</em> are not supported in HTML5 although due to backwards compatibility they can still be used.</li>
                <li><small>small</small>is used for small print</li>
                <li><strong>Strong</strong>conveys extra importance</li>
                <li><i>i </i>is used to show an alternate voice</li>
                <li><em>em </em>is used to emphasis.</li>
                <li><cite>cite </cite>is for an authors works</li>
                <li><a href="#">a</a> is now an anchor on steroids. It is an important tag since its the one that connects the web</li>
                <li>Javascript APIs are now specified so now browser vendors have a script from which to go on. This ensures better compatibility</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Rich media is among the new advances being brought about by HTML5</li>
                <li>"Plugins" would be required to get rich media to be supported by the browser. HTML5 seeks to bring that to an end by making then native to the browser</li>
                <li>The <em>canvas </em>element is used to create dynamic pages. It does this through an API that is manipulated using javascript.</li>
                <li>A canvas is good in that it can be updated and redrawn based on users actions</li>
                <li>SVG although not adopted by HTML5 is better than canvas in that its DOM can be accessed</li>
                <li>JavaScript should be used as an enhancement tool by using an approach referred to as Unobtrusive JavaScript.</li>
                <li>The concept of boolean attributes such as <em>autoplay, loop</em> whose presence on a page determines if an action will be executed or not.</li>
                <li>A huge problem of relying on plugins is that they are sandboxed from the rest of the of the document and awesome things like styling cannot be performed on them.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>We see declarative replacement of commonly done scripted operations. Use with care as some of the browsers may not already support this.</li>
                <li>Placeholder - Puts temporary text in a textbox that is removed once a user starts typing</li>
                <li>Autofocus allows for your cursor to be put in a input element, select once you load the page. Only used once in a document</li>
                <li>Required is used to validate a form input</li>
                <li>Several input types are now added into the specifications that include: <em>search, tel, number, range, url, email, colour, date, time, month, datetime, datetime-local</em></li>
                <li>Browsers without support for this default to text input type</li>
                <li>The new types allow for control/ input suited to the type to be shown and also to vallidate the values entered</li>
                <li>There is a <em>pattern</em> attribute that allows you to use regex to define the kind of input you require</li>
            </ul>

        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>Class attribute can be used to add more semantic value to elements. CSS is just an example of a technology that makes use of the class attribute during styling.</li>
                <li>Microformats which are a set of agreed uon conventions by community uses the class attribute to extend HTML.</li>
                <li>Microformats work based on the pareto principal</li>
                <li>There are a bunch of new text-level semantics that have been introduced in HTML5.</li>
                <li><mark>mark</mark> element used for reference purposes due to in relevance in another context.</li>
                <li><time datetime="2015-03-07">July 3rd, 2015 - </time>Acts as a mediator between computers and machines</li>
                <li><meter low="10" high="26" min="0" max="30" optimum="20" value="28"></meter>It is cold today morning</li>
                <li><progress min="0" max="100" value="60"></progress>- I am getting impatient...</li>
                <li><em>Section - </em> used to group thematically related content</li>
                <li><em>header &amp; footer </em>used within documents and sections</li>
                <li><em>aside</em> - Used for tangentially related content</li>
                <li><em>nav</em> for major navigational content</li>
                <li><em>article</em> - for self-contained related content and widgets</li>
                <li>New structure elements introduced a model called <strong>sectioning content</strong></li>
                <li>In HTML5 each section has its own self-contained outline</li>
                <li><em>hgroup</em> To make a group share the outline of the first element</li>
                <li><em>Sectioning roots</em> are elements that don't conform to the outlinig algorithm. This include:
                      <ol>
                          <li>Blockquote</li>
                          <li>Fieldset</li>
                          <li>td</li>
                      </ol>
                </li>
                <li><em>scoped style - </em>Applies styles to scope of the element it is defined in.</li>
